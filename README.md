Keep ya JavaScripts Dinki-di!

This is a repo that I attempted to live-code for [Web Directions Code '12](http://code12melb.webdirections.org/). I'll be posting a list of links and pointers from the presentation here, so stay tuned.

Things I mentioned
------------------

- I'm [Jed Schmidt](http://jed.is). Find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/jedschmidt) or [Github](https://github.com).
- [typd.in](http://typd.in) is a Japanese IME bookmarklet I wrote.
- [Textpanda](http://textpanda.com) is another bookmarklet I wrote, inspired by Text Expander.
- [Pastebud](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/pastebud_brings_copy_and_paste_to_iphone.php) is the last bookmarklet I wrote, which solved early iPhone copy/paste issues.
- [140byt.es](http://140byt.es) is a tweet-length code-golfing contest I started, written in Node.js.
- [Ramendan](http://ramendan.com) is another Node.js contest I wrote, a 30-night ramen crawl based on the Twitter API.
- This whole presentation is about [package management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system).
- [node.js](http://nodejs.org) is the platform that makes everything I'm presenting possible.
- [npm](http://npmjs.org) is the Node.js Package Manager.
- Rubyists use [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/) and [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) to manage their packages.
- PHPists use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and [Packagist](http://packagist.org/) to manage theirs.
- Node.js is the [most popular programming platform on Github](https://github.com/popular/watched) with 15,000+ watchers, and has made JavaScript its [most popular language](https://github.com/languages).
- npm now has [more than 10,000 modules](https://search.npmjs.org/#/_analytics/alltime)
- Though it started on its own, npm is node and vice versa. [According to @ryah](http://twitter.com/ryah/status/202937162151378944), it may even eventually be called using `node`.
- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) was the inspiration for Dinkumisr, which I live-coded for this presentation.
- If you like Dinkumisr, you'll love [bogan ipsum](http://boganipsum.com/).
- If you're looking for an npm module, [nipster](http://eirikb.github.com/nipster/) is often more effective than `npm search`, at least until more curation is built-in.
- If you're releasing open-source code, [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/) makes it incredibly easy to test, and can be set up quickly using [travisify](https://github.com/substack/travisify). Looks like `npat` will bring similar functionality deeper into Node.js.
- An npm module needs only two things configured: a name and a version, the latter follows the [semver](http://semver.org) spec, which is basically a convention of <major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>.
- If you like managing your modules the way npm does, use [Browserbuild](https://github.com/learnboost/browserbuild) or [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/browserify) to bring it to the client.
